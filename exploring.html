        <h1>Exploratory Data Analysis</h1>
        <p>This page will do the data analysis on the Boston Beer Companyâ€™s stock price.</p>
        <br>
        <hr>
        

        <h3>Stock Price with SAM company:</h3>
        <p>
            The data collects the stock price of SAM company, which is a company that produces beer in Boston. The data I choose is the adjusted close stock price.<br>
            This is what the original data looks like. <br>
            We can see a big increase from the end of 2019 to 2020. However, by the middle of  2020, the stock price becomes decrease.<br>
            From the original graph, we can judge it has the tendency and not stationary. It is seasonal, not cyclic.<br>
            The data should be additive because the seasonal variation looks constant, it does not change when the time series value increases.<br>

        <h3>Lag plots</h3>
        <p>
            These are the lag plots of my dataset.<br>
            These lag plots show significant correlation of the stock price. The value will not change in a short period. <br>
            Otherwise, when we see lag 9, the correlation decreases but is still significant. <br>
            This means even as the time periods become longer, the stock price still has linear relationships with the lags.

        <h3>Decompositions</h3>
        <p>
            This is the decomposition of the stock price.<br>
            The decomposition shows the tendency of stock price and seasonality.<br>
            However, the randomness seems a little strange around 2020. The reason may be there is a huge and significant increase in 2020 so the graph has not much drop down performance.

        <h3>ACF and PACF</h3>
        <p>
            There are the acf and pacf of the original dataset. <br>
            The ACF plot shows the high correlation for the lags which we mentioned before. <br>
            On the other hand, the plots indicate our data is not stationarity since it has a significant relationship with previous data.<br>

        <h3>Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test</h3>
        <p>
            By using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test, we can see the p-value is 0.9778. <br>
            It is greater than 0.05 so we can judge that the data is not stationary.

        <h3>ACF with some transformation</h3>
        <p>
            The first graph is the original data, the second graph is the acf of differencing and the third one is acf of log transformation.<br>
            The second and third acf plot  show the stationary. Which means the log-transformation was very successful.

        <h3>New Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test</h3>
        <p>
            By using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test to the log transformation, we can see the p-value is 0.01. <br>
            It is smaller than 0.05 so we can judge that the data is stationary.

        <h3>Moving Average Smoothing</h3>
        <p>
            This is the moving Average Smoothing plots, I use different MA smoothing for my data.<br>
            The first graph is plotted by MA = 7, which is a weekly time period. We can see the MA graph is overfit the original graph.<br>
            The second graph is plotted by MA = 30, which is a monthly time period. We can see the MA graph has a small curve and follows with the original one.<br>
            The third graph is plotted by MA = 90, which is a quarterly time period. We can see the MA graph has a curve and also follows with the original one.<br>
            For these graphs, I may choose MA with 30 or 90. We can see the tendency of our data without overfitting or underfitting.
